    #  These three lines of code are all you need to initialize the
    #  OLED and print the splash screen.
  
    #  Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init
    #  all of the pins and configure the OLED.


    print("\nSparkFun Micro OLED - Hello Example\n")
    myOLED = qwiic_micro_oled.QwiicMicroOled()

    if myOLED.isConnected() == False:

            file=sys.stderr)
        return

    #  Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init all of the pins and configure the OLED.
    myOLED.begin()

    myOLED.clear(myOLED.PAGE)  #  Clear the display's buffer

    myOLED.print("Hello World")  #  Add "Hello World" to buffer

    #  To actually draw anything on the display, you must call the display() function.
